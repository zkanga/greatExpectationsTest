Create a Expectation parent class to provide a shared interface
    Allows for ease of use via inheritance/polymorphism via constructor and run method
    Allows for adding more expectations with relative ease as would only need to create new child class

Program flow:
    Read and validate expectations yml (Assuming existence)
    Create an array of n number of child expectation objects
        Can be multi-threaded to improve performance
    Read a CHUNK of input csv (Assuming existence)
        Chunk-size a variable hardcoded in a config
        'Necessary' in the case of large file sizes
    Each expectation object in the array runs on the chunk of csv data and stores results within itself
        Can be mutli-threaded for performance
    Repeat Chunk read and expectation objects run on each chunk until EOF (End of file)
    Iterate through child expectation objects to create a results.txt
    Write results.txt (Assuming valid write permissions)
