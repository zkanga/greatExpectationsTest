Dear Reviewers,

Thank you for taking the time to evaluate this technical assessment.

## Purpose
To showcase my abilities in python in my response to the technical assesment provided.


### Unit Tests
Please note that the unit tests included heavyweight unit test file in this assessment may be resource-intensive and may require significant time and processing power to execute. Please use the other assesments which include a light weight variant of the same test.

## Instructions for Reviewers
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Read my assumptions and notes in the NotesAndPrompt folder
2. Review the code, ideally by stepping through a run of the program starting from the start of main.py
3. Execute the unit tests and evaluate the candidate's solutions based on the provided criteria.
	- If using heavyweight test, you will need to pip install faker

Thank you once again for your valuable time.
