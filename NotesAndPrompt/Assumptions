General

    If a file has no data in it, fails because it has no header

    A file with a matching header but no records will passes because no records break expectations

    Assuming a user won't create a valid config without any expectations within the suite

    The expectations in the sample are written as a yml but written twice in the file as json
    I will write for now as a json
     - Confirmed by Robert via email

    Neither input file or expectation file is assured to exist

    The user can be trusted (i.e won't provide One instead of 1 as the RANGE_LWR)

    If the expectations fails in first chunk of reading, I should continue to read to capture all errors
        Rather than quickly failing and providing the initial failures

    Should overwrite results.txt if it exists
        Ideally a UUID or process detail of some sort would be appended to the title to never need to overwrite
            i.e results_fileName_utcTimestamp.txt

Expect Values:
    Allow for '1' == 1 equal True

Expect range:
    Ranges will be numerical integer

Edge cases:
    An expectation file exists with no expectations but the csv file doesn't exist
        Fail because you're still expecting a file
