General

    If a file has no data in it, fails because it has no header

    A file with a matching header but no records will passes because no records break expectations

    The expectations in the sample are written as a yml but written twice in the file as json
    I will write for now as a json
     - Confirmed by Robert via email

    The user can be trusted (i.e won't provide One instead of 1 as the RANGE_LWR)
    - from prompt


    Overwrite results.txt if it exists
        Ideally a UUID or process detail of some sort would be appended to the title to never need to overwrite
            i.e results_fileName_utcTimestamp.txt

Expect Values:
    Python == True to assure line meets expectation

Expect range:
    Ranges will be numerical integer
    The range expectation is inclusive
