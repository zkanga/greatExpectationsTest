Assumptions:
    General
        Can only have one record at the Suite level
            Should error out if there are more, one suite per file

        Neither input file or expectation file is assured to exist

        The user can be trusted (i.e won't provide One instead of 1 as the RANGE_LWR)

        If the expectations fails in first chunk of reading, I should continue to read to capture all errors
            Rather than quickly failing and providing the initial failures

        Should overwrite results.txt if it exists
            Ideally a UUID or process detail of some sort would be appended to the title to never need to overwrite
                i.e results_fileName_utcTimestamp.txt

    Expect Values:
        Allow for '1' == 1 equal True

    Expect range:
        Ranges will be numerical integer

    Edge cases:
        An expectation file exists with no expectations but the csv file doesn't exist
            Fail because you're still expecting a file
